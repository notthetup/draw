# Draw

INA260 based voltage and current __draw__ measurement board.

This is a INA260 based board for measuring voltage and current draw (with builtin shunt) and output over USB (CDC).

## V2.0 - Under development.

The idea with v2 is to use the [CH32X035](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32X035.html) MCU to provide a USB interface and a more powerful MCU.
    - CH32X035 has [Arduino support](https://github.com/openwch/arduino_core_ch32)
    - CH32X035 has a USB interface
    - CH32X035 has I2C interface to talk to the INA260

## V1.0
